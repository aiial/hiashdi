# Introduction

**HIASHDI** is the **Hospital Intelligent Automation Server Histrocial Data Interface**. HIASHDI (HIAS Historical Data Interface) is an implementation of a REST API Server that stores HIAS network historical data and serves it to authenticated HIAS devices & applications by exposing the data through a REST API and pushing data through subscriptions.

&nbsp;

# HIAS

![HIAS - Hospital Intelligent Automation Server](assets/images/HIAS.jpg)

[HIAS - Hospital Intelligent Automation Server](https://github.com/AIIAL/HIAS-Server) is an open-source automation server designed to control and manage an intelligent network of IoT connected devices and applications.

HIAS devices and applications are the **historical data producers** for the HIAS network. These devices and applications publish data to the historical broker using supported machine to machine communication protocols and the REST API.

HIAS devices and applications are also the **historical data consumers**. Devices and applications connected to the network consume historical data generated by the network.
